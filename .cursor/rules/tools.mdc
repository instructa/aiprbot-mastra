# Tool System

- Tools are defined in [src/mastra/tools/index.ts](mdc:src/mastra/tools/index.ts).
- Example: The weather tool fetches weather data from an external API.
- Tools provide external data or actions that agents can use to answer queries or perform tasks.
- Tools are registered with agents in [src/mastra/agents/index.ts](mdc:src/mastra/agents/index.ts) and used in workflows in [src/mastra/workflows/index.ts](mdc:src/mastra/workflows/index.ts).
- Tools are invoked by agents or directly by workflow steps as needed.
