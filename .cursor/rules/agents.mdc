# Agent System

- The agent(s) are defined in [src/mastra/agents/index.ts](mdc:src/mastra/agents/index.ts).
- Example: The weather agent is configured here, including its instructions, model, tools, and memory.
- Agents are responsible for processing user queries, using tools as needed, and generating responses.
- Agents are registered with the main system in [src/mastra/index.ts](mdc:src/mastra/index.ts).
- Agents are invoked by workflows to provide intelligent responses or actions.
