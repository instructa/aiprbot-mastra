how does the agent work can you give me e2e example. explain easy for me and also tell me all files which are involved

**Cursor**

Here's a simple explanation of how the agent works in your project, with an end-to-end (E2E) example and a list of all involved files.

## How the Agent Works (Easy Explanation)

1. **Agent Definition**  
   - The agent is like a smart assistant. In your code, you have a "Weather Agent" that knows how to answer weather questions.
   - It uses a language model (like GPT-4) and has special instructions on how to answer.
   - It can use tools (like a weather API) to get real data.
   - It remembers recent conversations using a memory system.

2. **Tool Integration**  
   - The agent can use a "tool" to fetch real weather data. This tool knows how to look up weather for a city using an online API.

3. **Workflow**  
   - A workflow is a step-by-step process. For example, you might have a workflow that:
     1. Gets the weather for a city.
     2. Asks the agent to suggest activities based on the weather.

4. **Putting It All Together**  
   - The agent and workflows are registered in the main system.
   - When you ask for the weather, the workflow runs: it fetches the weather, then asks the agent to respond or suggest activities.

## E2E Example (Weather Agent)

**Scenario:**  
You want to know the weather in "New York" and get activity suggestions.

**Steps:**
1. You (the user) ask: "What's the weather in New York?"
2. The workflow triggers:
   - Step 1: Uses the weather tool to fetch weather data for New York.
   - Step 2: Passes this data to the agent.
   - The agent replies with a formatted answer, possibly including activity suggestions.

## Files Involved

1. **Agent Definition**
   - `src/mastra/agents/index.ts`  
     - Defines the `weatherAgent` with instructions, model, tools, and memory.

2. **Tool for Weather**
   - `src/mastra/tools/index.ts`  
     - Defines `weatherTool`, which fetches weather data from an API.

3. **Workflow**
   - `src/mastra/workflows/index.ts`  
     - Defines a workflow that:
       - Fetches weather data.
       - Asks the agent to suggest activities.

4. **System Registration**
   - `src/mastra/index.ts`  
     - Registers the agent and workflow with the main system (`Mastra`).
